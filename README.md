# 🧠 Smart Asset Management System (SAMS)

A scalable, real-time, RFID/GPS-powered system for tracking, managing, and maintaining assets across departments, sites, and users — built with enterprise-grade reliability, usable by teams of any size.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

> "Fix asset chaos, one smart scan at a time."

**SAMS** helps organizations:
- 🏷️ Track physical assets (machinery, devices, furniture, etc.)
- 📍 Know where each asset is (location + GPS)
- 👨‍🔧 See who’s responsible
- 🛠️ Handle issues, maintenance, and asset transfers
- 📦 Print & scan QR/Barcode labels (RFID soon!)
- 🔒 Control who can do what — role-based access

Our MVP will start with CRUD & basic tracking, but the vision is **full IoT-based real-time asset intelligence.**
